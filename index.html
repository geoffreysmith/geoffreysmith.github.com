    <p>Often times, with multi-lingual sites, a company’s region is not based on geographic regions. Usually these are based on sales territories and we often find ourselves
defining regions as “English - Southeast Asia” that need their own special languages. Sitecore builds regions off Windows' list of cultures, to add a new region within
Sitecore we first need to add a region to Windows. Alex Shyba provides a great <a href="http://marketplace.sitecore.net/en/Modules/Custom_Language_Registration.aspx">Custom Language Registration</a>

    <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

    <p>Sitecore’s template processing is great and flexible, but has some severe limitations out of the box. The most 
glaring of these is the inability for Sitecore to handle certain types of complex content types. For example,
nearly every site I’ve encountered hash a tabbed FAQ section. This would entail adding a “tab” placeholder to a page
and allow Page Editor to add a rendering or sublayout to this section. This works great, except tabbed content presupposes
different content per tab. For example...</p>

    <p>One of the harder concepts to grasps for the Sitecore developer unaquainted

TDS is best described as a migrations utility, similar to ActiveRecord’s Migrations or the multitude of other migrations utilities.
Sitecore’s data structure, with a few caveats, is a document based database. The schema
to Sitecore’s database doesn’t change when we add new data types and there’s no relational
