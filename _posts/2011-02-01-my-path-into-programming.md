I often get the question of how I got into programming, I covered it briefly in [What I wish a Ruby programmer had told me one year ago][wish], but I've always wanted to cover it more greater detail.

I've always been interested in computers, when I was little I used it mainly for games but I sure enjoyed playing around with it outside games too. When I was about 10 I asked my dad how I could customize my page on the family website, and he ended up setting up a site with Frontpage for me. I had great fun dragging and dropping things into the WYSIWYG interface, creating a site that worked in nothing but IE6 (something I find very ironic now..). 

I had seen sites on the internet with all kinds of cool effects, so I quickly hit up google with the search term "cool scripts website" and found all kinds of small Javascript scripts to paste into the HTML part.

Looking at the generated HTML got me curious, and I fiddled around with this and the scripts I had downloaded.

When I discovered there were other browsers than IE, I quickly switched and realized my site didn't work in these. I figured that it was all Frontpage's fault, and I ended up switching to Dreamweaver. I went to the bookshop and found books on Dreamweaver. I had lots of fun building a new website for myself in Dreamweaver, with pop-up menus and all kinds of fancy things from the book.

At some point I got more curious about the "code" behind what Dreamweaver was magically crafting for me, thus I started learning HTML and later CSS. I liked the grater control from hand-coding my websites and I've been doing that ever since.

After having run blogs with pure HTML pages that I updated via FTP, I asked my dad how I could make it more dynamic with an administration interface. He gave me a quick introduction to PHP which I found extremely exciting, I started discovering it on my own hand. Downloading scripts of the internet, trying to get them work. Tried setting up a login system, succeeded when I learned that I needed something called a "Database".

PHP and I had fun times -- I build a site where people could review applications combined with a text-based game where you could buy a pink-vadar suite that gave 20 defense points, attacking other users on the site.

After I built that site I got sucked into the evil universe of playing games with friends.. so I didn't get to program for another 3 years.

When I returned, I thought I should do my website in tables -- quickly figured I was wrong. I relearned everything, and over the summer I started working on an idea, on the way I picked up Javascript (and jQuery). I ended up rewriting this site 3 times before I realized plain PHP wasn't working out for me. I wanted more structure and to achieve a better structure for my site, I needed a framework.

But these frameworks were all magic. I had no idea how they worked, so I ended up building my own framework. That has probably been my greatest learning experience so far. Building something that wasn't CRUD webinterfaces.

Although when I build the framework I came to dislike PHP more and more, I figured it might not be the programming language for me, so I picked up Python. I liked Python a lot, and I did a basic Django site. Someone told me about Ruby, and I decided to try it out. Much more about why I went to the Ruby side in my [other blog post][wish].

I started building basic Ruby applications, I mostly stuck with plain Ruby until an american company contacted me after writing "What I wish a Ruby programmer had told me one year ago" and asked whether I'd like to come work for them, where I started getting familiar with Sinatra and Rails.

In August I switched to work for a Danish startup, [Firmafon][fm], maintaining and developing the Rails backend, and that's what I'm doing now. Firmafon just got a venture investment around christmas, so I'm defiantly looking forward to working more with this awesome team.

I wanted this to have a more catchy title, such as "How I ditched Microsoft and got an awesome job", but I resisted..
