title: When we reach the sea, we'll build a bigger ship...

I've been enamored with Hedgehog's [Team Development for Sitecore](http://www.hhogdev.com/Products/Team-Development-for-Sitecore/Overview.aspx),
an essential product for any Sitecore developer. It is as close as we'll
get to a [database migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html)
utility for document oriented databases like Sitecore. The most compelling advantage,
and the one that doesn't make me wonder why I pay for a propietary tool to commit
database changes to source control, relies on TDS' ability deployment abilities.
It completely supplants existing [custom build processes (dropkick?)](https://github.com/chucknorris/dropkick),
currently in use, and works so well that any shortcomings only arouse discouragement
that these developers lack the omniscence I assume they had.
